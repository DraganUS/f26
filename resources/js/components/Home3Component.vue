        <h3>What you can measure with the Tachistoscope?</h3>
        <p>
            With the help of the tachistoscope, perception experiments can measure different effects of advertising materials, packaging designs and other motifs, which in reality are not perceived cognitively but only fleetingly and unconsciously. In this way it is possible to analyze which information is perceived and processed by the viewer at all.
            The diffuse impression, the emotional impression of the motif and the effects of colors and shapes become measurable.
            Particularly striking areas or details of an image template are easy to identify. By using the tachistoscope in the pre-test, individual elements of the advertising material can be subsequently optimized within the advertising effectiveness analysis.
